Ideas on how to get the traffic / filtered web traffic

Idea 1: Create a .py or bash script that run tcpdump -i <interface> .. i forget the rest

Idea 2: use pyshark 
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyshark/0.1

Steps:
Capture filtered HTTP traffic
Probably save to pcap file
Parse that pcap file 
dest/src IP
Maybe time
Idk , Mike fix this

Check if thereâ€™s a dictionary/list online/webpage of malicious webpages, check based off findings in pcap against those?

What do we want to virtualize/ display  ?
Maybe:
The images of sites that are visited
The alert system of a bad site
Destination of destination IPs on geographic map
Frequency of web pages visited 


-pcap user-inputted
-size webpages based off hits, increase bubble depending on how big the count is
-COLORS!!!!!
-Bubble will have a number 


Professor in-class suggestions: look at data sheet, columns, heading, sort on a specific column, see how groupings work; tied together, or scattered (2 or 3 groups, completely scattered?) Sort on A, then sort on B, see how data changes, unsort on B, then do C, etc.


Looks like Priya is working on the front end
Chris and Mike will research what to do on the back end
