### To Launch This Tool ###

Download the repository and unzip it in place of your choice

On the command line navigate into the “WASTED” directory

Use the command “python3 mapcreator.py”

Upon successful script execution, you will be prompted for "high", "medium", or "low" security sensitivity; 
high yields less false positives

You will be prompted for a wireshark .pcap/.pcapng file. 
If it is not in the same directory as "WASTED", you must provide the full path of the file 
(i.e. /home/Desktop/wireshark_capture.pcap).

Once the script generates the "mapper.html" file, 
it will automatically be opened in the default FireFox browser on the Linux machine.

The "Resources" directory contains the high.txt, medium.txt, and low.txt files, which contain
lists of various known malicious hostnames. It also includes feature1.png, feature2.png and 
feature3.png which display on the bottom of the webpage.html template.
